# MSc Project: Experimental Investigation of Brillouin Scattering Statistics

This repository contains the data, analysis scripts, and figures for an MSc project at Imperial College London. The experimental work was conducted at the Quantum Measurements Lab under the supervision of Professor Michael Vanner and Dr. Anthony Leung.

The project's primary goal is to experimentally characterize the statistical properties of light generated via Brillouin scattering. We investigate the transition from a thermal light field in the spontaneous regime to a coherent light field in the stimulated (lasing) regime. This is primarily achieved by measuring the second-order temporal correlation function, $g^{(2)}(\tau)$.

## 🔬 Experimental Approach

The project is structured in three main experimental stages:

1.  **Optical Spectrum Analyzer (OSA) Measurements**: To obtain a broad spectrum of the scattered light, identify the fundamental Stokes and Anti-Stokes peaks, and establish the lasing threshold.
2.  **Heterodyne Measurements**: To resolve the fine spectral features and measure the linewidth of the Brillouin acoustic modes with high precision.
3.  **Photon Correlation Measurements ($g^{(2)}(\tau)$)**: To directly measure the photon statistics and observe the transition from thermal bunching ($g^{(2)}(0)>1$) in the spontaneous regime to coherent light ($g^{(2)}(0)=1$) in the stimulated regime.
