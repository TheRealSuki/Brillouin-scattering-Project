# Brillouin-scattering-Project
This GitHub repo is designated to the MSc Project at Imperial College London. The measurements are happening at Imperial's Quantum Measurements Lab under the supervision of Micheal Vanner. 

The project outline briefly:
-OSA measurements of Brillouin scattering
-Heterodyne measurement of Brillouin scattering
-g^(2)(\tau) measurement of Brillouin spectra - expected to start from thermal state --> coherent state. (Do not expect non-classical behaviour)

OSA Measurements: In-Progress
Heterodyne Measurement: Not Started
g^(2)(\tau) Measurement: Not Started
